# WORK-001 – Epic: OmniRelay Transport & Pipeline Parity

This epic is split into iteration-sized stories (A–C) to ensure each can complete in one sprint without breaking the system.

## Child Stories
- **WORK-001A** – Mode-config parity & capability flags
- **WORK-001B** – Admin/diagnostics parity across modes
- **WORK-001C** – Cross-mode feature/perf validation

## Definition of Done (epic)
- All child stories done; identical behavior documented across in-proc, sidecar, and edge modes with published SLOs and green test suites.
