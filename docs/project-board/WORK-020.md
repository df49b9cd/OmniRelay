# WORK-020 – Epic: Synthetic Probes & Partition Tests

Split into iteration-sized stories (A–B).

## Child Stories
- **WORK-020A** – Synthetic probes for control/data paths
- **WORK-020B** – Partition simulations and LKG verification

## Definition of Done (epic)
- Probes continuously validate control/data health; partition simulations verify LKG and recovery.
