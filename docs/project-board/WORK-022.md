# WORK-022 – Epic: Samples & Docs Alignment

Split into iteration-sized stories (A–C).

## Child Stories
- **WORK-022A** – In-proc vs sidecar vs edge samples
- **WORK-022B** – Extension lifecycle samples (DSL/Wasm/Native)
- **WORK-022C** – Identity/capability/failover docs & diagrams

## Definition of Done (epic)
- Samples/docs match current schemas and modes; runnable scripts validate key paths.
