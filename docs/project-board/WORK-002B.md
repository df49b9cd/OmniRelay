# WORK-002B – Performance Baselines & Published SLOs

## Goal
Measure and publish p95/p99 latency/throughput baselines per deployment mode and key paths (routing, filter chain, extensions).

## Scope
- Micro/meso benchmarks for representative workloads.
- Capture alloc rate/CPU counters; store baseline artifacts.
- Publish SLO targets and guidance in knowledge-base.

## Deliverables
- Benchmark suite updates and run scripts.
- Baseline report checked into repo or artifacts.
- Docs with SLOs and tuning tips.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Benchmarks run and produce baselines for in-proc, sidecar, edge.
- SLOs documented and approved by stakeholders.

## Status
Open
