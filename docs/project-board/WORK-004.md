# WORK-004 – Epic: Deployment Packaging (In-Proc, Sidecar, Edge)

Split into iteration-sized stories (A–D).

## Child Stories
- **WORK-004A** – In-proc host package (NuGet) with capability manifest
- **WORK-004B** – Sidecar container hardening (non-root, readonly, health)
- **WORK-004C** – Headless edge binary/image + capability manifest
- **WORK-004D** – Signing/SBOM pipeline for all artifacts

## Definition of Done (epic)
- Per-RID signed artifacts available for all hosts; minimal footprints; health endpoints validated.
