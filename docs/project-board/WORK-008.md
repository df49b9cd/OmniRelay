# WORK-008 – Epic: MeshKit Local Agent

Split into iteration-sized stories (A–D).

## Child Stories
- **WORK-008A** – LKG cache & signature validation
- **WORK-008B** – Control stream client (resume/backoff) without election
- **WORK-008C** – Telemetry forwarding with buffering/backpressure
- **WORK-008D** – Resource/security hardening and footprint measurements

## Definition of Done (epic)
- Agent reliably caches/apply LKG, renews certs, forwards telemetry, and remains lightweight and non-authoritative.
