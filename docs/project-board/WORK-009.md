# WORK-009 – Epic: Bootstrap & Watch Harness

Split into iteration-sized stories (A–C).

## Child Stories
- **WORK-009A** – Deterministic startup pipeline (LKG → stage → activate)
- **WORK-009B** – Watch lifecycle (backoff/resume/state machine)
- **WORK-009C** – Validation hooks & observability

## Definition of Done (epic)
- Shared harness used by all hosts/roles; startup and watch flows observable and resilient.
