CLI + Tooling:

src/OmniRelay.Cli/Program.cs (line 1830) (RunAutomationAsync) and  (line 2196) (RunMeshLeadersStatusAsync/RunMeshLeadersWatchAsync) drive scripts, HTTP requests, introspection, delays, and SSE streaming, but we only assert “file missing” or “URL invalid”. Add fixture scripts to cover happy-path execution, --dry-run, --continue-on-error, SSE parsing, and timeout branches so CLI regressions are caught.
src/OmniRelay.Cli/CliRuntime.cs (lines 24-183) wires the default host, file-system, HTTP client, and gRPC invoker. No test proves DefaultServeHostFactory actually wires AddOmniRelayDispatcher, or that DefaultGrpcInvokerFactory starts/stops/cleans up GrpcOutbound. Introduce unit tests that substitute fake IHost/GrpcOutbound instances and assert lifecycle + disposal semantics.


Dispatcher + Transport:

src/OmniRelay.Configuration/Internal/DispatcherBuilder.cs (line 140) enforces that HTTPS HTTP inbounds must provide certificates, but no configuration test currently asserts the exception path (the OmniRelayConfigurationTests focus on successful DI setup). Add a test feeding an HTTPS URL without tls and expect OmniRelayConfigurationException.
src/OmniRelay.Configuration/Internal/DispatcherBuilder.cs (lines 155-229) handles gRPC inbound validation plus custom inbound specs, yet we lack coverage for “missing URL”, “missing spec”, “spec not registered”, and service-name overrides. Craft targeted tests with fake specs to ensure those guards fire.
src/OmniRelay.Configuration/Internal/DispatcherBuilder.cs (lines 271-417) (RegisterOutboundSet) and  (lines 420-456) (CreateHttpOutbound) introduce HTTP outbound restrictions (no streaming), client caching, and named HttpClientFactory integration. There are no tests asserting these constraints—existing configuration tests only look at simple unary HTTP outbounds. Add cases that attempt to configure streaming HTTP, verify caching hits, and ensure named client resolution works.
src/OmniRelay.Configuration/Internal/DispatcherBuilder.cs (lines 510-607) plus  (lines 609-620) cover the new gRPC outbound flow: endpoint-level HTTP/3 hints, TLS/runtime options, peer chooser specs, and cache keys. Nothing in tests/OmniRelay.Configuration.UnitTests exercises remote-service overrides, HTTP/3 validation, or custom peer spec errors, so those paths remain untested.
src/OmniRelay.Core/Transport/TeeOutbounds.cs:231-351 & 474-559 adds background-drain logic, aggregated stop semantics, and oneway teeing, but Codecov reports 0% on the new sections. Augment tests/OmniRelay.Core.UnitTests/Transport/TeeOutboundsTests.cs with cases that (a) verify DrainShadowWorkAsync cancels outstanding work, (b) assert simultaneous start failure stops both outbounds, and (c) cover the oneway path and aggregated exceptions.


Leadership + Gossip:

src/OmniRelay/Core/Leadership/LeadershipCoordinator.cs (lines 174-360) and  (lines 493-588) contain the new evaluation loop logic: gossip gating, election backoff, renew failure handling, lease health updates, and shard scope resolution. Current tests (tests/OmniRelay.Core.UnitTests/Leadership/LeadershipCoordinatorTests.cs (lines 13-173) plus the integration suite) only cover “elect someone” and “wait for gossip healthy”, so scenarios like renewal failure, expired leases transitioning to PublishLoss, shard namespace parsing, and _leaseHealthTracker updates are entirely untested.
src/OmniRelay/Core/Leadership/LeadershipEventHub.cs (lines 36-111) implements snapshot-first subscriptions, per-scope filtering, backlog drops, and cancellation cleanup, yet there is no direct unit test; coverage only comes indirectly through coordinator tests. Add focused tests that subscribe, assert the initial snapshot emission, simulate backlog overflow (ensure DroppedEvent fires), and ensure cancellation removes subscriptions.
src/OmniRelay/Core/Leadership/LeadershipGrpcExtensions.cs (lines 1-45) converts internal events/tokens to protobuf types; nothing verifies enum mapping (e.g., SteppedDown → ProtoLeadershipEventKind.SteppedDown) or label preservation. A simple serialization test would guard against wire regressions.
src/OmniRelay/Core/Gossip/MeshGossipHost.cs:200-360 & 400-447 now manages HTTP/3 listener TLS, outbound gossip rounds, sweep loops, and lease-diagnostics updates, but MeshGossipHostTests only hit reflective helpers like ProcessEnvelopeAsync. Add tests that spin up the host with fake _httpClient/_membership to cover ExecuteRoundAsync, sweep transitions, and UpdateLeaseDiagnostics.
src/OmniRelay/Core/Gossip/MeshGossipCertificateProvider.cs (lines 30-145) contains certificate reload logic (inline Base64 vs. file path, timestamp polling, error cases) and currently has zero references in tests/OmniRelay.Core.UnitTests. Tests should cover: missing path, invalid Base64, automatic reload when the file timestamp changes, and ensuring secrets are zeroed.
src/OmniRelay/Core/Gossip/MeshGossipMembershipTable.cs (lines 30-150) introduces RefreshLocalMetadata, MarkSender, Sweep, and PickFanout behavior. While we test observation and fanout basics, there’s no coverage for metadata refresh versioning, sender RTT updates, or sweep transitions to Left, leaving 27 lines untested per Codecov.
These are the hotspots driving the Codecov warning—filling them with targeted unit/integration tests will raise the patch coverage and, more importantly, lock down the new behaviors. Natural next steps are to prioritize high-risk runtime paths first (CLI automation, dispatcher builder validation, leadership renewals) so we uncover regressions before landing further changes.
